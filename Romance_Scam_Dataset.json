When he declined and offered to meet at a public place (Acropolis Mall), she refused. On another occasion, he agreed to meet a different girl at a café in Dhakuria.

The total reached ₹10,139, which he was pressured to pay. After the incident, he realized it was a pre-planned scam between the woman and the café",

    "Summary": "A 22-year-old male student matched with a woman on a dating site in March. They bonded quickly; she presented herself as a 26-year-old woman. Initially, she requested a meal to be ordered for her, promising repayment. After a week, he agreed and she paid back once, building trust. Soon, she repeatedly requested money, which over three months (March–June) totaled ₹11,000. During this time she also sent explicit pictures, creating emotional and sexual dependency. Later, she began making excuses — citing her mother’s death and “mental issues.” Realizing the scam, the victim contacted her from another Telegram ID pretending to be a “friend of a blackmailed victim.” She immediately recognized him, exposing her guilt, and then threatened to file a harassment complaint to scare him into silence. The victim fears legal trouble but has not committed any crime; the threat is a manipulation tactic to regain control.",

    "Summary": "A male victim from India fell prey to a sextortion racket over a two-month period, losing approximately ₹2.5 lakh through multiple payments. The scammer — likely part of a call-centre-based operation — used 20+ phone numbers to continue the threats, exploiting the victim’s fear of social exposure. Despite blocking all numbers and cutting contact, the scammer still has access to the victim’s family and relatives’ contact details, amplifying ongoing fear. The victim has filed anonymous complaints on the cybercrime portal, but is too afraid to go to local police due to the possibility of his parents finding out. Even after stopping communication, he experiences constant anxiety, fear of exposure, and learned helplessness, characteristic of post-extortion trauma syndrome.",
